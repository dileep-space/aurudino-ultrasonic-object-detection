# Arduino Ultrasonic Object Detection

This project uses an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to detect objects and control an LED indicator.

## Components
- Arduino Uno
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- LED
- 220Ω Resistor
- Jumper wires

## Pin Connections
Trig → Pin 9  
Echo → Pin 10  
LED → Pin 12  
VCC → 5V  
GND → GND

## Working
The ultrasonic sensor measures the distance to an object.
If the object is within a defined range, the LED turns ON.
